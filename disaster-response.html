            <p><strong>FAA Licensed Drone Surveying:</strong> FAA-licensed commercial drone pilots conduct aerial surveys of disaster-affected areas to assess damage, locate individuals in need, and guide recovery efforts.</p>
            <p><strong>First Aid Capabilities:</strong> The team offers immediate first aid and basic medical care in disaster zones, addressing physical needs as an expression of faith.</p>
            <p><strong>Spiritual Counseling:</strong> The team provides prayer, scriptural guidance, and pastoral support to help individuals find peace, strength, and hope through their faith.</p>
            <p><strong>Business and Homeowner Recovery Assistance:</strong> Assistance is provided for clean-up efforts, debris removal, and restoration of homes and properties, along with guidance on recovery plans and coordination with local services.
