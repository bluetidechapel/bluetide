            <p>In addition to our chaplaincy services, Blue Tide Chapel is proud to have a highly skilled and active Disaster Response Team. This team is dedicated to offering comprehensive on-the-ground support during times of crisis, with services guided by our faith in Christ, including:

            Nursing Care and Triage Support: Our team includes registered nurses with emergency training and experience, providing critical nursing care, triage, and medical support. Through compassionate healthcare, we seek to reflect God’s care for all people.

            FAA Licensed Drone Surveying: Our volunteer team includes FAA-licensed commercial drone pilots who use advanced drones to survey disaster-affected areas. These aerial surveys help assess damage, locate individuals in need, and guide recovery efforts, allowing us to serve with wisdom and efficiency.

            First Aid Capabilities: Our team is equipped to provide immediate first aid and basic medical care in disaster zones, serving the physical needs of those in crisis as an expression of our faith.

            Spiritual Counseling: At the heart of our mission is providing spiritual care. Our team offers prayer, scriptural guidance, and pastoral support, helping individuals find peace, strength, and hope through their faith during difficult times.

            Business and Homeowner Recovery Assistance: In the aftermath of disasters, we are also committed to helping businesses and homeowners recover. Our team provides resources and support for clean-up efforts, assisting with debris removal and helping individuals restore their homes and properties. We offer guidance on recovery plans, help coordinate local services, and provide spiritual and emotional support to those facing the challenges of rebuilding.

            Whether responding to natural disasters, emergencies, or other large-scale incidents, our team of faith-driven professionals and volunteers is prepared to deliver compassionate care with a focus on serving Christ through service to others. We are committed to bringing the hope and healing of Christ to those in need, reinforcing our dedication to ministry, service, and outreach.
